# Path-Finding-and-Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization

This is a desktop app for windows to show case and visualize how algorithms work.
The algorithms shown are A-Star and Dijkstra's for pathfinding and Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort for the sorting Algorithms.
I tried to implement merge sort or quick sort but I ran into logistical issues with implementing them into the app because they are recursive.
C# WPF .Net Core 3.1 was used for making this because I wanted to get some practice using C# and WPF.
Also because I felt using WPF was one of the easier ways to make this because it gives easy access to UI controls and layouts for the user and the graphics.
Unfortunately because of this, the app is Windows only.

For A Star and Dijkstra's Algorithms, press the S key and click to mark the start point, press the E key and click to mark the end, and simply click on any other
quad/node to make it a barrier. The algorithm starts when both the start and the end nodes are chosen.
The number of rows and columns can also be changed using the UI controls below the grid.

For the sorting algorithms, just press the space bar to start the visualization. 
The number of bars to be sorted can also be changed by using the UI controls at the bottom.
